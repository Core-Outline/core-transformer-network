      "Return on ad spend (ROAS) is a metric used to measure the total revenue generated per advertising dollar spent. It is calculated by dividing the campaign revenue by the campaign cost.\n",
      "Customer acquisition cost (CAC) enables companies to determine how much money they spend on attracting new customers, taking into account marketing, sales and other costs. For SaaS companies, it is important tomake sure that the cost of acquiring customers does not exceed the amount of money generated by them. The following formula can be used to calculate exactly how much money a company spends on customer acquisition:By measuring the amount of money spent on attracting customers, companies can then formulate the most cost-effective acquisition strategy.\n",
      "Lifetime Value (LTV) is the cumulative gross proﬁt contribution, net of CAC, of the average customer in a cohort.LTV is determined by taking CAC, Dollar Retention, and Gross Margin into account to evaluate overall company health. If NRR is greater than 100%, LTV can increase indeﬁnitely. However, if customers churn, LTV will ﬂatten out and stop increasing.Healthy cohorts cross the $0 LTV line before month 12, and LTV grows to at least 3x the original CAC over time.\n",
      "It is the time of how many months it takes for a customer to generate enough gross proﬁt to pay back their CAC.Lower-margin products with high CAC do poorly on payback.\n",
      "The act of comparing your customer acquisition cost and customer lifetime value as a ratio.\n",
      "The Marketing % of Customer Acquisition Cost is the marketing portion of your total CAC, calculated as a percentage of the overall CAC.\n",
      "The Marketing Originated Customer % is a ratio that shows what new business is driven by marketing, by determining which portion of your total customer acquisitions directly originated from marketing efforts.\n",
      "The Marketing Inﬂuenced Customer % takes into account all of the new customers that marketing interacted with while they were leads, anytime during the sales process.\n",
      "Total ROI from the email marketing campaign.\n",
      "Marketing qualiﬁed leads or MQLs are leads who have expressed an interest through marketing channels or campaigns. That could be a download of an eBook or signup to your newsletter. These are great ways to track how your marketing efforts are helping to drive leads.\n",
      "Product-qualiﬁed leads (PQLs) are the new MQLs for some SaaS businesses. Remember when we mentioned signups? PQLs are signups that can be differentiated like this.Signup is just signup. A PQL is a signup followed by a series of engagements from that user. The difference is the intent to continue to use a product. As such, deﬁnitions for PQLs will vary from business to business.\n",
      "MRR is the widely used metric to understand how much revenue customers are generating over the course of a month. In the SaaS realm, this amountof projected new revenue can come from either new sales or existing business expansions.\n",
      "ARR reveals how much revenue a company generates over the course of a year. Both ARR and MRR offer organizations insight into the ﬁnancialwell-being of their business and its collective progress.\n",
      "Annual run rate (ARR) is your monthly recurring revenue (MRR) annualized. It’s a prediction of how much revenue your company will generate annually based on your current MRR. This metric is predominantly used in companies with MRR and no ARR (Annual Recurring Revenue)ARR assumes that nothing else will change in your business over the year (no new customers, no churn, or expansion revenue).\n",
      "Committed Monthly Recurring Revenue (CMRR) is a prediction metric that combines recognized monthly recurring revenue (MRR) with new sign-ups, churn, and downgrades/upgrades.\n",
      "Contraction MRR is MRR lost from existing customers. The lost revenue could come from customers downgrading their plan, reducing the number of users on their plan, missing their payment or anything else that decreases the amount of money an existing customer pays you monthly.There’s one thing you have to keep in mind though. Contraction MRR does not include customers who’ve cancelled. It should only include revenue lost from customers who are still active.\n",
      "Expansion MRR is additional MRR that comes from existing customers. It could be from users who’ve upgraded their account, purchased an add-on product, added additional users to their account or anything else that increases the amount of money they pay you each month.In some cases, you can build opportunities for the expansion of MRR directly into your business model. For instance, if you sell a B2B SaaS product aimed at teams, you can charge per seat. As your customer’s team grows, they’ll add additional users to their account, which creates expansion MRR for you.\n",
      "The Quick Ratio of a SaaS company is the measurement of its growth eﬃciency.\n",
      "Return on investment (ROI) is the value you need to understand how your work impacts your bottom line. For marketing in particular, if you’re not securing a high return on your investment, then you need to assess your output.\n",
      "Simply, net negative churn is when current customers are spending so much additional money (services, upgrades, and add-ons) that your churn is offset by it.\n",
      "Total costs incurred to build and operate your product.For an average cost of service, sum up these expenses on an annual basis and divide by customer count to derive ACS.\n",
      "Is your growth being driven by only a few big contracts or many small ones? In easy terms is it just concentrated from one source?It is a potential red ﬂag if too much revenue is concentrated within a few large accounts or contracts. If fewer customers make up the majority of revenue, that’s there is a signiﬁcant risk to the business that needs to be vetted.On the other hand, if the largest customer is less than 10% of revenue, that indicates low customer concentration.\n",
      "ACV is a metric that shows the average yearly value of a customer’s subscription.ACV helps companies ﬁgure out their strategy for sales and marketing. Calculate your company’s ACV by dividing the value of the contract by the total years of the contract.\n",
      "Net Revenue Retention (NRR) or Dollar Retention measures how much of your revenue is generated by a cohort of customers each period relative to its original size.NRR takes expansion revenue into account and can be greater than 100% if expansion exceeds churned and contracted revenue. The best SaaS companies have 120%+ NRR each year. NRR of less than 100% per year is evidence of a Leaky Bucket and is problematic.\n",
      "Magic Number is the Net New ARR for a period divided by its sales and marketing expenses from the prior period. Ideally, the ratio should be greater than one.\n",
      "Gross Margin reﬂects a company’s margin after subtracting the cost of goods sold (COGS) from revenue.For SaaS companies, COGS typically consist of subscription costs on a monthly or annual basis to keep the product operating. There can be good reasons for lower gross margins early in a company’s lifecycle, but in the long term, SaaS companies should have a Gross Margin of over 60%.low Gross Margins can be evidence of a classic automation problem where the company is putting their human force to work rather than automating existing workﬂows.\n",
      "Net Proﬁt Margin or net margin is the percentage of net income generated from a company's revenue. Net income is often called the bottom line for a company or the net proﬁt.\n",
      "Burn Multiple is a company’s Net Burn divided by its Net New ARR in a given period (typically annually or quarterly).It is a number of how much the startup is burning in order to generate each incremental dollar of ARR. The higher the Burn Multiple, the more the startup is burning to achieve each unit of growth. The lower the Burn Multiple, the more eﬃcient the growth is.For fast-growing SaaS companies, a Burn Multiple of less than one is amazing, but anything less than two is still quite good. If a startup has a high Burn Multiple but low CAC, that could indicate that sales and marketing costs have been miscategorized.\n",
      "The hype rate is used to measure capital eﬃciency, which equals Capital Raised (or Burned) divided by ARR. But we prefer Burn Multiple because it focuses on recent performance.\n",
      "Daily / Weekly / MonthlyThe number of users who open and engage with your app/software on a daily, weekly and monthly basis.\n",
      "SaaS companies rely heavily on subscription services and the revenue it brings.Customer churn is a primary concern. Customer churn refers to the measurement of customers or accounts that drop a business’ services within a given period of time. By determining the churn rate, SaaS companies can gain a deep understanding of how and when customers interact with their products, which enables them to form better retention strategies.Once a customer leaves a company’s services, the race to attract and retain a new one begins. It is critical for scaling companies to determine customer churn rate, as it provides deeper insight into the overall health of the business.\n",
      "The ratio of daily active users to weekly active users.A good metric for most SaaS startups is 60% DAU/WAU during non-holiday weekdays, meaning that the typical weekly user visits the site 3 out of 5 weekdays.\n",
      "The ratio of daily active users to monthly active users.A good metric for most SaaS startups is 40% DAU/MAU during non-holiday weekdays, meaning that the typical monthly user visits the site at least two weekdays per week or 8 times per month.\n",
      "The Net Promoter Score (NPS) enables companies to assess the loyalty of their customer base.NPS allows companies to quickly determine how their customers feel about their products. Companies often measure NPS through the use of simple survey questions, which usually address consumers’ willingness to reuse a product or recommend it to someone else.For young SaaS businesses, this metric is especially useful, as it allows organizations to make any needed adjustments to their product or services early on so they can keep growing their customer base.\n",
      "Or ARPU - Average Revenue Per User in most casesThe average revenue per user (ARPU) is the average amount of revenue you earn from each of your active customers monthly.\n",
      "Activation rates, sometimes also known as sign-up to paid conversion rates, are the percentage of your customers that go from newly acquired to performing an activity that signals they are using your software.Calculate the activation rate by dividing the number of users who complete an activity by the number of new users who signed up.\n",
      "Attrition Rate also known as customer turnover is the rate at which you lose customers over time. This metric differs from the churn rate in that it doesn’t account for the net total including new users. It focuses only on customers lost.This measure is vital to track monthly or annually to spot an uptick in customer dissatisfaction. Calculate your customer attrition rate by dividing the number of customers leaving by your total number of customers in the period.\n",
